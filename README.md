  # Reid Back's Portfolio
  
  ## Description
  
   This is my portfolio, it's a small example of some work I have done and what my styling looks like like. I used a couple third party libraries for the functionality/animations. Click on the logos (generated with microsoft copilot) to either see the deployed application (if it has a front end) or be taken to the github repo if it doesn't have a frontend.
